//! Storage-agnostic CRUD access, backing `crud`. See
//! `docs/adrs/0001-mvc-layering-with-a-generic-crud-interface.md` for why
//! this layer exists as a trait with two implementations (SeaORM-backed,
//! in-memory) rather than one hand-written per-resource data-access class.
//!
//! Rust-specific deviation from the Python original's `Repository`
//! protocol (documented in that ADR's port): Python's `SQLAlchemyRepository`
//! is generic over *any* mapped model at runtime, because SQLAlchemy's
//! `Base.registry` and Python's dynamic attribute access let one class
//! introspect an arbitrary model's columns. SeaORM's `EntityTrait` is
//! statically generated per entity, so a single Rust `impl` cannot be
//! generic over "any SeaORM entity" without unwieldy trait-bound
//! machinery. Instead, `Repository` is generic via **associated types**
//! (read model `Model`, create payload `Create`, update payload `Update`),
//! and each resource provides one small `impl` per backend (SeaORM +
//! in-memory) that maps those types onto its own entity's columns.
//! `crud::CrudService<R>` itself stays fully generic and contains zero
//! resource-specific code -- the same payoff `NFR-0004`
//! (`docs/nfrs/0004-generic-crud-excludes-resource-logic.md`) describes,
//! just with the entity-specific column mapping living one layer lower
//! than in the Python original.
